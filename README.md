# multicrop2

This is a copy of Fred Weinhaus' multicrop2, a command line photo editing tool that detects images from a single file and separates them.

Fred's original multicrop2 only works with ImageMagic v6 and lower. In ImageMagic rev7, command syntax was restructured making multicrop2 unusable.

Both ImageMagic versions 6 and 7 can be loaded on various OS's but instead of going through that excercise, I decided to modify the commands in the script to work with IM 7.

Fred has a full description of multicrop2 usage on his website [link text](http://www.fmwconcepts.com/imagemagick/multicrop2/index.php)
